            <h2>PacMen Exercise</h2>
            <div class="PacMen">

            </div>
           
            <p>This project's goal was to create a game where you can click to add PacMen (as many as you please) before then clicking "start" which animates the PacMen to move around the screen until they hit a wall and return back. To make this a little more fun, I have edited this project to give it a little "teeth". PacMan isn't really angry... just hungry. Well, "hangry".
              Future improvements to this project would be to add pieces of Pie that you can add with another button and run away from the PacMen to avoid being eaten. Who doesn't like pie?
              Hopefully you enjoy and I will be coming back to this project often.

              <h2>Real Time Bus Tracking Exercise</h2>
              <div class="BusTracker">
                <img src="BusTracker.png" alt="HangryMen">
              </div>
            <p>This is a map of the bus stops between my parents house in Dallas and my own house. To begin the route move your mouse over the button and click when you see a blue border appear. This will begin the bus journey between the two houses.
              During this project I adjusted the map styling to be "blueprint", changed the font and a few characteristics of the button. I have also changed the color of the marker to be "red".
              Future improvements would be to have the marker labled with bus details, and if you need to change busses the description would change at that stop.

            <h2>Eye Exercise</h2>
            <div class="Eyes">
              <img src="Eyes.png" alt="HangryMen">
            </div>
            <p>This project was to make a pair of eyes that will follow the curser of our mouse around the webpage screen. To operate the project you do not need to do much more than move the mouse around and watch the madhatter (cat) eyes follow your “mouse” around. Cats eat mice so it will stay fixated on the curser as if it is the real thing. 
              I decided to make the eyes cat like and change the background to make the project a little more fun for the user. 
              Eventually, I would like to make the curser turn into a small rodent and add more features to the cat, like ears or a cat tail waiving in the background.
